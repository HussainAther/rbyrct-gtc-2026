# 🩻 RBYRCT: Real-Time, Low-Dose Breast CT via CUDA-Accelerated Localized MART.

🩻 Can we make cancer screening 100x faster and safer?

I’m entering my project, RBYRCT, for the #NVIDIAGTC Golden Ticket! We used @NVIDIADeveloper CUDA to accelerate CT reconstruction by orders of magnitude. By optimizing the MART algorithm on GPUs, we’re enabling low-dose, high-accuracy imaging for safer breast cancer detection.

We are achieving 100x acceleration in CT reconstruction, turning hours of compute into seconds of real-time diagnostic insight using NVIDIA CUDA.

## The Vision: Safer, Earlier Breast Cancer Detection
Breast cancer screening saves lives, but current CT scans often demand high radiation doses for clear images, posing a risk, especially to younger patients. Additionally, traditional imaging methods are frequently uncomfortable, invasive, and involve painful compression.

RBYRCT (Ray-by-Ray Computed Tomography) is our patent-pending, GPU-optimized iterative reconstruction technology designed to solve this.

RBYRCT's Game-Changing Advantages:

Reduced Radiation Exposure: Our technology is engineered to cut the required radiation dose without sacrificing image detail, potentially transforming early cancer detection safety.

No Compression: Our patient-friendly design minimizes discomfort and anxiety, making the imaging process less invasive and more manageable for women.

Higher Accuracy: Earlier and more precise tumor detection leads to better patient outcomes.

We are establishing a new gold standard in medical imaging that prioritizes both diagnostic accuracy and patient well-being.

## The Appeal: Support Janus Sphere Innovations
Hi, I'm Syed Hussain Ather—scientist, innovator, and the driving force behind Janus Sphere Innovations.

Over the past year, I have voluntarily committed over $10,000 of my personal funds and 100% of my time to this project. Every step—publishing our research ([Link to Published Work]), securing legal counsel, and forming a business foundation—has been driven by a commitment to make this life-saving vision a reality.

### Why You Can Trust Us
Our work is built on scientific and ethical integrity, guided by professional legal teams:

Patent Team: Rapacke Law Group is protecting our intellectual property.

Business Formation: EPGD Business Law is establishing our corporate foundation.

Scientific Team: Our collaborators, including Dr. Richard Gordon, ensure we maintain the highest standards.

### What we built

This project combines two worlds:

* **MART (Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstruction Technique)** — an advanced algorithm that can reconstruct good images even from sparse or noisy CT data.
* **GPU Acceleration with NVIDIA CUDA** — MART is powerful but slow on CPUs. With NVIDIA GPUs, it becomes *10–100× faster*, making it practical in real-time.

### The core idea

Think of CT like taking **many X-ray “shadows”** of an object from different angles, then piecing them together.

* The **old way (FBP, Filtered Back Projection)** is fast but needs a *lot* of X-rays (higher dose).
* Our way (**RBYRCT MART on GPUs**) can do the same job (or better) with fewer X-rays (lower dose) — meaning *less radiation for patients*.

### Results at a glance

* ⚡ **Speed**: GPU MART runs in milliseconds vs. seconds for CPU.
* 🩻 **Image quality**: Cleaner reconstructions in sparse-angle, noisy settings.
* 🌍 **Impact**: Aiming for **earlier, safer breast cancer detection worldwide**.

## Usage

### Run Benchmarks

Run the grid benchmark and auto-save results to `assets/`:

```bash
make bench
```

* `assets/bench_table.md` – Markdown summary (drop directly into slides/docs)
* `assets/runtime_vs_size.png` – runtime scaling plot

### Launch Demo

Interactive app for MART vs FBP side-by-side reconstruction:

```bash
make demo
```

### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Formatting & Linting

```bash
make format   # black
make lint     # flake8
```

### Troubleshooting
- **No GPU?** Runs CPU-only automatically. Set `RBYRCT_FORCE_CPU=1` to force CPU.
- **Colab GPU mismatch (cudaErrorInsufficientDriver)?** 
  `pip uninstall -y cupy* && pip install cupy-cuda12x` (or `11x` if `nvidia-smi` shows 11.x), then Runtime → Restart.
- **Import error?** We set `PYTHONPATH` in the notebook; no editable install needed.
